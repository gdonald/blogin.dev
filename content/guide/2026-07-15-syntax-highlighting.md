description: Server-side highlighting for fenced code.
---
Set `"highlight": true` in `blogin.json` and Blogin highlights fenced code during
the build. Highlighting is server-side: there is no client JavaScript, and the
pages work without it.

A fenced block's info string names the language:

````
```raku
my $x = 1;  # a comment
```
````

The highlighter tokenizes the code into spans, escaping the source:

```raku
my $greeting = "hello";  # keywords, strings, numbers, comments
```

Recognized languages are raku, ruby, python, javascript, bash, and json. An
unrecognized language falls back to escaped plain text with no spans.

## Styling

Highlighting emits `hl-keyword`, `hl-string`, `hl-number`, and `hl-comment`
classes. The build emits `blogin.css` with a default color scheme for them, along
with base styling for code blocks and heading anchors. Link it from `base.haml`
and override any rule in your own stylesheet. Because the spans are plain HTML,
any color scheme is a matter of CSS.
